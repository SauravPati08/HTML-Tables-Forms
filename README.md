# HTML-Tables-Forms
The &lt;table> element represents data with more than one dimension, in the form of a table. A table cell is one grouping within a chart table used for storing information or data. Cells are grouped horizontally (rows of cells) and vertically (columns of cells). Each cell contains information relating to the combination of the row and column headings it is collinear with. In software design, table cells are a key component in HTML and webpage building, and it is part of the <table> component. A coder may specify dimensions for a table cell, and use them to hold sections of webpages.

A webform, web form or HTML form on a web page allows a user to enter data that is sent to a server for processing. Forms can resemble paper or database forms because web users fill out the forms using checkboxes, radio buttons, or text fields. For example, forms can be used to enter shipping or credit card data to order a product, or can be used to retrieve search results from a search engine.
Forms can be made up of standard graphical user interface elements:

<text> — a simple text box that allows input of a single line of text.
<email> - a type of <text> that requires a partially validated email address
<number> - a type of <text> that requires a number
<password> — similar to <text>, it is used for security purposes, in which the characters typed in are invisible or replaced by symbols such as *)
<radio> — a radio button
<file> — a file select control for uploading a file
<reset> — a reset button that, when activated, tells the browser to restore the values to their initial values.
<submit> — a button that tells the browser to take action on the form (typically to send it to a server)
<textarea> — much like the <text> input field except a <textarea> allows for multiple rows of data to be shown and entered
<select> — a drop-down list that displays a list of items a user can select from

A grid view, however, can be mimicked by using a standard HTML table with each cell containing a text input element. A tree view could also be mimicked through nested tables or, more semantically appropriately, nested lists. In both cases, a server-side process is responsible for processing the information, while JavaScript handles the user-interaction. Implementations of these interface elements are available through JavaScript libraries such as jQuery.
