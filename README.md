# HTML-Tables-Forms
The &lt;table> element represents data with more than one dimension, in the form of a table. A table cell is one grouping within a chart table used for storing information or data. Cells are grouped horizontally (rows of cells) and vertically (columns of cells). Each cell contains information relating to the combination of the row and column headings it is collinear with. In software design, table cells are a key component in HTML and webpage building, and it is part of the &lt;table> component. A coder may specify dimensions for a table cell, and use them to hold sections of webpages. And A webform, web form or HTML form on a web page allows a user to enter data that is sent to a server for processing. Forms can resemble paper or database forms because web users fill out the forms using checkboxes, radio buttons, or text fields. For example, forms can be used to enter shipping or credit card data to order a product, or can be used to retrieve search results from a search engine.
